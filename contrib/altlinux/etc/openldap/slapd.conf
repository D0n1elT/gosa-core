# in userPassword, during processing of LDAP Password Modify Extended

# Specify a set of conditions (separated by white space) to require (default
# none). The directive may be specified globally and/or per-database. bind
# requires bind operation prior to directory operations. LDAPv3 requires
# session to be using LDAP version 3. authc requires authentication prior to
# directory operations. SASL requires SASL authentication prior to directory
# operations. strong requires strong authentication prior to directory
# operations. The strong keyword allows protected "simple" authentication as
# well as SASL authentication. none may be used to require no conditions
# (useful for clearly globally set conditions within a particular database).

# the root DSE. These attributes are returned in addition to the attributes
# normally produced by slapd.

# Specify a set of factors (separated by white space) to require. An integer
# value is associated with each factor and is roughly equivalent of the
# encryption key length to require. A value of 112 is equivalent to 3DES, 128
# to Blowfish, etc..

#
# [ TLS OPTIONS ]
#
# Permits configuring what ciphers will be accepted and the preference order.
# <cipher-suite-spec> should be a cipher specification for OpenSSL.
#TLSCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:+SSLv2

# Specifies the path of a directory that contains Certificate Authority
# certificates in separate individual files. Usually only one of this or the
# TLSCACertificateFile is used.
#TLSCACertificateFile /etc/openldap/ssl/slapd.pem
#TLSCACertificatePath /etc/openldap/ssl

# Specifies the file that contains the slapd server certificate.
#TLSCertificateFile /etc/openldap/ssl/slapd.pem

# Specifies the file that contains the slapd server private key that matches
# the certificate stored in the TLSCertificateFile file. Currently, the private
# key must not be protected with a password, so it is of critical importance
# that it is protected carefully.
#TLSCertificateKeyFile /etc/openldap/ssl/slapd.pem

# Specifies what checks to perform on client certificates in an incoming TLS
# session, if any.
#TLSVerifyClient never

# [ BACKEND OPTIONS ]

# Options in this section only apply to the configuration file section for the
# specified backend. They are supported by every type of backend.

#
# [ DATABASE OPTIONS ]
#
# Mark the beginning of a new database instance definition.
#database ldbm

# Specify the DN suffix of queries that will be passed to this backend
# database. Multiple suffix lines can be given and at least one is required for
# each database definition. If the suffix of one database is "inside" that of
# another, the database with the inner suffix must come first in the
# configuration file.
#suffix "dc=example,dc=com"

# Specify the distinguished name that is not subject to access control or
# administrative limit restrictions for operations on this database. An empty
# root DN (the default) specifies no root access is to be granted. It is
# recommended that the rootdn only be specified when needed (such as when
# initially populating a database).
#rootdn "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com"

# Specify a password (or hash of the password) for the rootdn. This option
# accepts all RFC 2307 userPassword formats known to the server (see
# password-hash desription) as well as cleartext.
#rootpw secret

# Controls whether slapd will automatically maintain the modifiersName,
# modifyTimestamp, creatorsName, and createTimestamp attributes for entries.
#lastmod on

# Specifies the maximum number of aliases to dereference when trying to resolve
# an entry, used to avoid inifinite alias loops.
#maxderefdepth 1

# This option puts the database into "read-only" mode. Any attempts to modify
# the database will return an "unwilling to perform" error.
#readonly on

# Specify a replication site for this database. Refer to the "OpenLDAP
# Administrator's Guide" for detailed information on setting up a replicated
# slapd directory service.
#replica uri=ldaps://ldap2.example.com/

# Specify the name of the replication log file to log changes to.
# replogfile	/var/lib/ldap/replog

# Specify that the current backend database is a subordinate of another backend
# database. A subordinate database may have only one suffix. This option may be
# used to glue multiple databases into a single namingContext.
#subordinate

# This option is only applicable in a slave slapd. It specifies the DN allowed
# to make changes to the replica
#updatedn "cn=slave,dc=example,dc=com"

# Specify the referral to pass back when slapd(8) is asked to modify a
# replicated local database. If specified multiple times, each url is provided.
#updateref "uri=ldap://ldap2.example.com"

# Specify the directory where the LDBM files containing this database and
# associated indexes live.
directory       "/var/lib/ldap"
#directory /var/lib/ldap/bases/example.com

# Specify the indexes to maintain for the given attribute (or list of
# attributes). Some attributes only support a subset of indexes.Specify the
